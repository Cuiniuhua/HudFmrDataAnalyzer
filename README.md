HudFmrDataAnalyzer
==================

The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Market Rent Data Analyzer application is written in Python. It was written as
part of my work in the CUNY Master of Science, Data Analytics program to exercise various programming techniques in
Python and analyze the Fair Market Rent data sets offered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The app is a simple form using the TkInter user interface layer. Development of the app was performed on Windows 8.1,
and no testing has been performed on other platforms, though no known Windows dependencies exist.

The following screenshots provide a brief overview of the current functionality:
